Title: Copy number variant detection from exome sequencing read depth

Description: Detection of copy number variants (CNV) from exome
        sequencing samples, including unpaired samples.  The package
        implements a hidden Markov model which uses positional
        covariates, such as background read depth and GC-content, to
        simultaneously normalize and segment the samples into regions
        of constant copy count.
