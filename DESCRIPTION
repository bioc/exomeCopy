Title: CNV detection from exome sequencing read depth
Version: 1.1.10
Date: 2012-03-12
Author: Michael Love
Maintainer: Michael Love <love@molgen.mpg.de>
Description:  Detection of copy number variants (CNV) from exome sequencing samples, including unpaired samples.  The package implements a hidden Markov model which uses positional covariates, such as background read depth and GC-content, to simultaneously normalize and segment the samples into regions of constant copy count.
